This is where our tortoises live!

Teletortoise is a version of NetLogo that runs remotely on a server while displaying in a web browser.

Tortoise is a version of NetLogo that runs entirely within the browser (without having as many features as Teletortoise).

The tortoises are the NetLogo versions of the future!  Curious to know more?  Want to try?  Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/NetLogo/Galapagos/wiki) for more details.
